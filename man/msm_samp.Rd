}
\value{
An object of class \code{survivl_dat} containing the simulated data.
}
\description{
Obtain samples from a specified (survival-valued) marginal structural model,
using the frugal parameterization.
}
\details{
Samples from a Marginal Structural Model specified
by a frugal parameterization; that is, one must specify the
marginal model (i.e. the dependence of the outcome on the
treatments), the distribution of the covariates, observed
confounders and treatments, and then a copula to join the distribution
of the outcome to that of the confounders.

Among the left-hand sides of outcome variables, the variable \code{Cen} has a
special meaning as censoring.  This keyword can be changed to something
else by using the argument \code{censor} in the \code{control} list.

Times for presimulated events are put at halfway between the two timepoints;
this is a hack.
